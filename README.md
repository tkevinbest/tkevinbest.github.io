I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Robotics Department at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on the control algorithms of robotic knee-ankle prostheses and their effects on user outcomes. In general, I am interested in dynamics, the control of robotic systems, optimization, and the human motor control. 

# Core Research Projects
<!---
During my time at Michigan, I've worked on three primary research questions:
1) How should we control robotic (powered) prostheses such that they provide the greatest possible benefit to the user while remaining clinically-viable? 
2) How can we measure these benefits? In what ways can robotic prostheses provide better outcomes for people compared to the commonly-used passive prostheses? 
2) How does varying a control property called joint impedance on the user's gait, particularly regarding stability. 

In addition, I've gotten to contribute to

## Data-Driven Impedance Control For Knee-Ankle Prostheses
The prevailing paradigm in lower-limb robotic prosthesis control is to use hand-designed controllers with heuristically tuned behaviors. While these approaches can be very effective, they are labor-intensive in both the design of the behaviors and in individualizing them to each individual at the point-of-care. In this work, we instead developed a data-driven control architecture that allowed the prosthesis to work over continuums of tasks without requiring manual tuning.
